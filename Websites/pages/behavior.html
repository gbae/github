	As it is in life, many similarities also occur in chemistry. When we see the reaction below: 

<p>Mom     +     Dad          Baby

<p>What did we start with (reactants): mom and dad
What did we end with (products): baby

<p>Whatever stays on one side, STAYS ON THAT SIDE. They CANNOT be changed. It is not possible to make “mom” with dad and baby, nor make “dad and mom” from a baby alone. 

<p>Perhaps a more relatable example is needed. 

<p>Eggs     +     Milk     +     Flour     +     Sugar          Cake

You need all the reactants in order to create the cake. You CANNOT move eggs and cake around, then say you made “eggs” from milk, flour, sugar and cake. Not possible. AT ALL. So don’t do it!!!
