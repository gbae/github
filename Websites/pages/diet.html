	The debate between whether schools or universities should adapt e-textbook or hard copy textbook has been discussed seriously in the last few years, especially the emergence of E-readers and iPad.  An e-book (short for electronic book,or EBook), also known as a digital book, is an e-text that forms the digital media equivalent of a conventional printed. Please take a position for or against for the question, and justify why you take such position. 
<p>
 Yes, E-textbooks are more learning effective than hard copy textbooks. Because of the invention of Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML, reading has changed forever. Now students can read an E-textbook, highlight the interesting passages, check for definitions, write comments, and mark bookmarks. Supporters of hard copy textbooks would say that they could do that with hard copies as well. Yes, thatâ€™s true. However, how about dimming the screen at night, or changing font and background colors for readers with disabilities? In addition, iPads, for example, can hold more than one book, PDF, or other online documents. Hard copy textbooks supporters would say that students could do that too, but think how uncomfortable it would be to carry around the hard copy, dictionaries, articles, PDFs and other documents.
