Hello, it's me
<p>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
</p>To go over everything
<p>They say that time's supposed to heal ya
<p>But I ain't done much healing
<p>
<p>Hello, can you hear me?
<p>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
<p>When we were younger and free
<p>I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
<p>
<p>There's such a difference between us
<p>And a million miles
<p>
<p>Hello from the other side
<p>I must have called a thousand times
<p>To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
<p>But when I call you never seem to be home
<p>Hello from the outside
<p>At least I can say that I've tried
<p>To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
<p>But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
